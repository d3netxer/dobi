dobi
====

A build automation tool for Docker applications.

Keep your project tasks organized, portable, repeatable, and fast with ``dobi``.
Define the resources and tasks required to build, test, and release your project in
a ``dobi.yaml`` and run them with ``dobi TASK``.

See `Getting Started <https://dnephin.github.io/dobi/>`_

Features
--------

Key features of ``dobi``:

* **optimal** - tasks are only run when the resource is stale. If a resource
  hasn't changed the task is skipped.
* **portable** - all tasks run in a container, so developers are free to use
  different operating systems and environments.
* **repeatable** - tasks are defined in a ``dobi.yaml`` so new contributers can
  get started quickly, and a task will always produce the same results.
  Variables are supported, but must be explicitly defined, so there's no hidden
  environment variables that could change the behaviour of a task.
* **organized** - tasks can be chained together using an ``alias`` resource to
  produce entire workflows like ``test`` or ``release``, which may involve
  multiple independent tasks.
* **dependencies** - tasks can depend on other tasks using ``depends``. When a
  task is run, its dependencies are checked first, and run if they are stale.
